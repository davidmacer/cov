   abstract = {The Geospatial Determinants of Health Outcomes Consortium (GeoDHOC) study investigated ambient air quality across the international border between Detroit, Michigan, USA and Windsor, Ontario, Canada and its association with acute asthma events in 5- to 89-year-old residents of these cities. NO 2, SO2, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured at 100 sites, and particulate matter (PM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at 50 sites during two 2-week sampling periods in 2008 and 2009. Acute asthma event rates across neighborhoods in each city were calculated using emergency room visits and hospitalizations and standardized to the overall age and gender distribution of the population in the two cities combined. Results demonstrate that intra-urban air quality variations are related to adverse respiratory events in both cities. Annual 2008 asthma rates exhibited statistically significant positive correlations with total VOCs and total benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) at 5-digit zip code scale spatial resolution in Detroit. In Windsor, NO2, VOCs, and PM 10 concentrations correlated positively with 2008 asthma rates at a similar 3-digit postal forward sortation area scale. The study is limited by its coarse temporal resolution (comparing relatively short term air quality measurements to annual asthma health data) and interpretation of findings is complicated by contrasts in population demographics and health-care delivery systems in Detroit and Windsor. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.},

   abstract = {Photochemical smog, characterized by high concentrations of ozone (O3) and fine particles (PM2.5) in the atmosphere, has become one of the top environmental concerns in China. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the key precursors of O3 and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) (an important component of PM2.5), have a critical influence on atmospheric chemistry and subsequently affect regional and global climate. Thus, VOCs have been extensively studied in many cities and regions in China, especially in the North China Plain, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta regions where photochemical smog pollution has become increasingly worse over recent decades. This paper reviews the main studies conducted in China on the characteristics and sources of VOCs, their relationship with O3 and SOA, and their removal technology. This paper also provides an integrated literature review on the formulation and implementation of effective control strategies of VOCs and photochemical smog, as well as suggestions for future directions of VOCs study in China.},

There is now a good qualitative and, in a number of areas, quantitative understanding of the tropospheric chemistry of NO(x) and VOCs involved in the photochemical formation of ozone.

However, there are still areas of uncertainty which impact the ability to accurately model the formation of ozone in urban, rural and regional areas, and these include a need for: rate constants and mechanisms of the reactions of organic peroxy (RO2) radicals with NO, NO3 radicals, HO2 radicals and other RO2 radicals; organic nitrate yields from the reactions of RO2 radicals with NO, preferably as a function of temperature and pressure; the reaction rates of alkoxy radicals for decomposition, isomerization, and reaction with O2, especially for alkoxy radicals other than those formed from alkanes and alkenes; the detailed mechanisms of the reactions of O3 with alkenes and VOCs containing >C=C< bonds; the mechanisms and products of the reactions of OH-aromatic adducts with O2 and NO2; the tropospheric chemistry of many oxygenated VOCs formed as first-generation products of VOC photooxidations; and a quantitative understanding of the reaction sequences leading to products which gas/particle partition and lead to secondary organic aerosol formation.

Research findings have demonstrated that some air pollutants occur more frequently and at a higher concentration in indoor air than in outdoor air, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this context, the indoor environment can be of crucial importance because modern society spends most of their time indoors, and exposure to VOCs may result in a spectrum of illnesses ranging from mild, such as irritation, to very severe effects, including cancer. These effects have been seen at very low levels of exposure in many epidemiological studies.

For isoprene and monoterpenes, an extended summary of standard emission factors, with data related to the plant genus and species, is included. The data compilation shows that we have quite a substantial knowledge of the emission of isoprene and monoterpenes, including emission rates, emission regulation, and biosynthesis. The situation is worse in the case of numerous other compounds (other VOCs or OVOCs) being emitted by the biosphere. This is reflected in the insufficient knowledge of emission rates and biological functions. Except for the terpenoids, only a limited number of studies of OVOCs are available: data are summarized for alkanes, alkenes, carbonyls, alcohols, acids, and esters. In addition to closing these gaps of knowledge, one of the major objectives for future VOC research is improving our knowledge of the fate of organic carbon in the atmosphere, ending up in oxidation products and/or as aerosol particles.},

   abstract = {Ambient air measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) were conducted and characterised during a two-year grid study in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of southern China. The present grid study pioneered the systematic investigation of the nature and characteristics of complex VOC and OVOC sources at a regional scale. The largest contributing VOCs, accounting over 80% of the total VOCs mixing ratio, were toluene, ethane, ethyne, propane, ethene, butane, benzene, pentane, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. Sub-regional VOC spatial characteristics were identified, namely: i) relatively fresh pollutants, consistent with elevated vehicular and industrial activities, around the PRD estuary; and ii) a concentration gradient with higher mixing ratios of VOCs in the west as compared with the eastern part of PRD. Based on alkyl nitrate aging determination, a high hydroxyl radical (OH) concentration favoured fast hydrocarbon reactions and formation of locally produced ozone. The photochemical reactivity analysis showed aromatic hydrocarbons and alkenes together consisted of around 80% of the ozone formation potential (OFP) among the key VOCs. We also found that the OFP from OVOCs should not be neglected since their OFP contribution was more than one-third of that from VOCs alone. These findings support the choice of current air pollution control policy which focuses on vehicular sources but warrants further controls. Industrial emissions and VOCs emitted by solvents should be the next targets for ground-level ozone abatement. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play important roles in the tropospheric atmosphere. In this study, VOCs were measured at an urban site in Guangzhou, one of the megacities in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer/flame ionization detection (GC MS/FID) and a proton transfer reaction timeof-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS). Diurnal profile analyses show that stronger chemical removal by OH radicals for more reactive hydrocarbons occurs during the daytime, which is used to estimate the daytime average OH radical concentration. In comparison, diurnal profiles of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) indicate evidence of contributions from secondary formation. Detailed source analyses of OVOCs, using a photochemical age-based parameterization method, suggest important contributions from both primary emissions and secondary formation for measured OVOCs. During the campaign, around 1700 ions were detected in PTR-ToF-MS mass spectra, among which there were 462 ions with noticeable concentrations. VOC signals from these ions are quantified based on the sensitivities of available VOC species. OVOC-related ions dominated PTR-ToF-MS mass spectra, with an average contribution of 73%9 %. Combining measurements from PTRToF-MS and GC MS/FID, OVOCs contribute 57%10% to the total concentration of VOCs. Using concurrent measurements of OH reactivity, OVOCs measured by PTR-ToFMS contribute greatly to the OH reactivity (19%10 %). In comparison, hydrocarbons account for 21%11% of OH reactivity. Adding up the contributions from inorganic gases (48%15 %), 11% (range of 0 % 19 %) of the OH reactivity remains missing", which is well within the combined uncertainties between the measured and calculated OH reactivity.

   abstract = {Spatial representativeness of air quality monitoring stations is a critical parameter when choosing location of sites and assessing effects on population to long term exposure to air pollution. According to literature, the spatial representativeness of a monitoring site is related to the variability of pollutants concentrations around the site.As the spatial distribution of primary pollutants concentration is strongly correlated to the allocation of corresponding emissions, in this work a methodology is presented to preliminarily assess spatial representativeness of a monitoring site by analysing the spatial variation of emissions around it. An analysis of horizontal variability of several pollutants emissions was carried out by means of Geographic Information System using a neighbourhood statistic function; the rationale is that if the variability of emissions around a site is low, the spatial representativeness of this site is high consequently.The methodology was applied to detect spatial representativeness of selected Italian monitoring stations, located in Northern and Central Italy and classified as urban background or rural background. Spatialized emission data produced by the national air quality model MINNI, covering entire Italian territory at spatial resolution of 4×4km2, were processed and analysed.The methodology has shown significant capability for quick detection of areas with highest emission variability. This approach could be useful to plan new monitoring networks and to approximately estimate horizontal spatial representativeness of existing monitoring sites. Major constraints arise from the limited spatial resolution of the analysis, controlled by the resolution of the emission input data, cell size of 4×4km2, and from the applicability to primary pollutants only. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

To that end, a systematic review was carried out, revealing that machine learning tools have been primarily used for clustering and classifying variables and indicators according to the problem analyzed, while tools such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines are the most widely used to predict different types of events.

   abstract = {Air pollution has become a serious public health problem for many cities around the world. To find the causes of air pollution, the propagation processes of air pollutants must be studied at a large spatial scale. However, the complex and dynamic wind fields lead to highly uncertain pollutant transportation. The state-of-The-Art data mining approaches cannot fully support the extensive analysis of such uncertain spatiotemporal propagation processes across multiple districts without the integration of domain knowledge. The limitation of these automated approaches motivates us to design and develop AirVis, a novel visual analytics system that assists domain experts in efficiently capturing and interpreting the uncertain propagation patterns of air pollution based on graph visualizations. Designing such a system poses three challenges: A) the extraction of propagation patterns; b) the scalability of pattern presentations; and c) the analysis of propagation processes. To address these challenges, we develop a novel pattern mining framework to model pollutant transportation and extract frequent propagation patterns efficiently from large-scale atmospheric data. Furthermore, we organize the extracted patterns hierarchically based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and empower expert users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively on the basis of pattern topologies. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach through two case studies conducted with a real-world dataset and positive feedback from domain experts.},

   abstract = {Visual analytics employs interactive visualizations to integrate users' knowledge and inference capability into numerical/algorithmic data analysis processes. It is an active research field that has applications in many sectors, such as security, finance, and business. The growing popularity of visual analytics in recent years creates the need for a broad survey that reviews and assesses the recent developments in the field. This report reviews and classifies recent work into a set of application categories including space and time, multivariate, text, graph and network, and other applications. More importantly, this report presents analytics space, inspired by design space, which relates each application category to the key steps in visual analytics, including visual mapping, model-based analysis, and user interactions. We explore and discuss the analytics space to add the current understanding and better understand research trends in the field. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York & Science Press, China.},

   abstract = {In today's applications data is produced at unprecedented rates. While the capacity to collect and store new data grows rapidly, the ability to analyze these data volumes increases at much lower pace. This gap leads to new challenges in the analysis process, since analysts, decision makers, engineers, or emergency response teams depend on information "concealed" in the data. The emerging field of visual analytics focuses on handling massive, heterogenous, and dynamic volumes of information through integration of human judgement by means of visual representations and interaction techniques in the analysis process. Further-more, it is the combination of related research areas including visualization, data mining, and statistics that turns visual analytics into a promising field of research. This paper aims at providing an overview of visual analytics, its scope and concepts, and details the most important technical research challenges in the field. © 2006 IEEE.},

In this system, an Overview + Detail approach is utilized for analyzing the correlation of air quality under both the spatial and temporal dimensions and different spatial-temporal scales. An annular container is proposed to preserve the context spatial information while the zoom level of the map changes. Based on the annular container, several analysis techniques such as STL decomposition view and correlation algorithm are integrated.},

   abstract = {The study of aerosol composition for air quality research involves the analysis of high-dimensional single particle mass spectrometry data. We describe, apply, and evaluate a novel interactive visual framework for dimensionality reduction of such data. Our framework is based on non-negative matrix factorization with specifically defined regularization terms that aid in resolving mass spectrum ambiguity. Thereby, visualization assumes a key role in providing insight into and allowing to actively control a heretofore elusive data processing step, and thus enabling rapid analysis meaningful to domain scientists. In extending existing black box schemes, we explore design choices for visualizing, interacting with, and steering the factorization process to produce physically meaningful results. A domain-expert evaluation of our system performed by the air quality research experts involved in this effort has shown that our method and prototype admits the finding of unambiguous and physically correct lower-dimensional basis transformations of mass spectrometry data at significantly increased speed and a higher degree of ease. © 2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Some studies have shown that air pollution is one of the important risk factors for human health. In order to find out the transmission mode, space-Time patterns, main pollution causes and potential mode of air pollution, we analyzed the multi-granularity and multi-dimensional data, and designed a visual analysis scheme of air pollution data, which integrated time, space and relevant factors, and used many kinds of visual charts, including map, calendar chart, single axis scatter chart and so on. Based on these, a data-driven visual analysis system is designed and implemented, and a variety of visual analysis models are established. The interactive methods such as filtering, scaling and exploration can assist users to carry out the data analysis tasks such as data overview, key data tracking, comparing of correlation, analytic reasoning, hypothesis testing and potential mode discovery, and realize the analysis of key causes, spatiotemporal evolution and transmission mode of air pollution. The system is simple and efficient, which can provide valuable reference for in-depth analysis of air pollution data and evaluation of air pollution control measures.},

   abstract = {Abstract: Smog is one of the most important environmental problems in China. Scientists have attempted to explain the causes from chemistry, physics, atmosphere and other perspectives. Many meteorologists believe that meteorology is a crucial reason. In this paper we present a new multi-view approach to visual analytics of the recent smog problems in China. This approach integrates four interrelated visualizations, each specialized in a different analysis task. To reveal the relationship between smog and meteorological attributes, we design a Correlation Detection View that simultaneously visualizes the air quality change patterns across multiple cities and related meteorological attributes. Component Trend View is used to show the variation patterns of six air components, while Aggregation View can reveal the regional overall pollution situations. A case study has been conducted using the China Air Quality Observation Data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts re-analysis data to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. By visually analyzing the meteorological data of Beijing and other major cities, we have found several interesting patterns, which prove the validity of our work in identifying sources of smog.

In the last decade, the steady improvement of data storage devices and means to create and collect data along the way influenced our way of dealing with information: Most of the time, data is stored without filtering and refinement for later use. Virtually every branch of industry or business, and any political or personal activity nowadays generate vast amounts of data. Making matters worse, the possibilities to collect and store data increase at a faster rate than our ability to use it for making decisions. However, in most applications, raw data has no value in itself; instead we want to extract the information contained in it. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
